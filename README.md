Powerful RSA cracker for CTFs. Supports RSA, X509, OPENSSH in PEM and DER formats.

RsaCracker provides a simple interface to crack RSA keys and ciphers. With a collection of thousands of attacks, no key <!-- or at least that's what I hope --> can survive against RsaCracker!
## Installation

From crates.io:

```console
cargo install rsacracker
```

Note: To build on windows, you need to use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). This is required because of the [rug](https://crates.io/crates/rug) dependency. See [building-on-windows](https://gitlab.com/tspiteri/gmp-mpfr-sys#building-on-windows) for more information.

## Docker

From dockerhub:

```console
docker pull skyf0l/rsacracker
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/data skyf0l/rsacracker [args]
```

Or build it yourself:

```console
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . --file Dockerfile -t rsacracker
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/data rsacracker [args]
```
